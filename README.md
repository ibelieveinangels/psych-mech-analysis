# psych-mech-analysis
Comparative analysis of molecular targets, transcriptomic signatures, and adverse event profiles of classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline).

## Project Overview
This project explores publicly available pharmacological and transcriptomic datasets to:
- Map shared vs. unique molecular targets of classical psychedelics
- Analyze reported transcriptomic responses
- Investigate links between mechanisms and adverse event profiles

## Hi!!!
I am **Angel**.
This is my **first Data Analysis project**, started on **2025-10-05**, created to self-teach tools and workflows used in **data analysis and bioinformatics**.

## Project Goals
1. Create clean, reproducible data pipelines
2. Generate comparative receptor-target maps
3. Visualize transcriptomic responses
4. Relate findings to reported adverse event profiles

## Example Research Questions
1. Which molecular targets are most consistently activated across classical psychedelics?
2. How do transcriptomic signatures diverge between psilocybin and LSD?
3. Can off-target receptor interactions explain reported adverse events?
