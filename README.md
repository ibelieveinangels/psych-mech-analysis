# psych-mech-analysis
Comparative analysis of molecular targets, transcriptomic signatures, and adverse event profiles of classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline).

# Project Overview
This project explores publicly available pharmacological and transcriptomic datasets to:
- Map shared vs. unique molecular targets of classical psychedelics
- Analyze reported transcriptomic responses
- Investigate links between mechanisms and adverse event profiles
